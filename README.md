# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The old game you used to play with everyone.

We used GOOGLE TEACHABLE MACHINE TO train a bot and then exported the model to Ml5.js (editor p5.js) where we created the basic 
structure of the game.

Just Download the files below and try the game out.


Note: Since we trained the bot in a brown wall background with our own hands it might be a little glitchy while scanning your hand
during gameplay properly but the game works smooth and just refresh it and wait for loading if any error persists.
